Code for Controlling two DC Brushed Motors remotely from an x86 PC (Linux/Windows) using RS485 Protocol and MSP430 Launchpad.

The Motors are connected to the PC through a twisted pair RS485 cable and the software running on the PC will control the two motors.

The Software is written in both **C sharp (C#) and Python** so that they can be run on multiple systems like Windows,Linux,BSD etc.

- **C#** Code runs on **.Net Framework** on Windows and **Mono** Framework on Linux.

- Python codes for both **Python 2.7.x** as well as **Python 3.x.x** are provided
